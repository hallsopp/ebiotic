# EBIotic

EBIotic is a sleek Rust library tailored for seamless integration with
the [European Bioinformatics Institute's (EBI)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/)
services. This library simplifies RESTful queries, converting them into straightforward Rust functions and delivering
the results as Rust data structures for effortless use in further analysis. It doesn't stop there; EBIotic also taps
into the renowned BLAST tool from [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), broadening its utility. With EBIotic,
navigating the bioinformatics landscape
becomes a smoother journey, enabling your applications to leverage EBI's rich datasets and NCBI's robust tools with the
performance and reliability of Rust.

## Features

- [ ] EBI DB/KB API
- [ ] EBI Tools API
- [x] NCBI BLAST

## Installation

The library is currently not stable but is available on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/ebiotic). To install, add
the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
ebiotic = "0.0.11"
```

## TODO

- Add more tests
- Add more documentation
- Add more examples
- Remove `unwrap()`s, `panic!()`s, and `expect()`s and replace with custom error handling
- work on polishing existing services (adding additional API options, etc.)
- Once MVP is working with raw results returned, can work on adding additional functionality to parse results into
  structured data
